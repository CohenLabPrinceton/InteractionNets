This repo contains tools for analyzing cell motion with deep "interaction network" style neural networks. 

The "simulations" folder contains scripts for producing track data from numerical simulators of collective behaviors, including the classic "Boids" model, by Craig Reynolds. 

Simulations enable us to validate the networks prior to analysis of real-world systems.
